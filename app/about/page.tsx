      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m Blake Parkinson — an engineering leader passionate about building
        AI-driven products that improve mental health and human connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <strong>Two Chairs</strong>, I lead teams creating applied AI systems
        that help therapists deliver more effective care — including NLP-powered
        note audits and smart matching between clients and clinicians.
      </p>
      <p>
        My background spans startups and platforms like Edmodo and Backbone PLM,
        scaling from early engineering roles to executive leadership. I’m
        passionate about thoughtful team culture, pragmatic technical strategy,
        and building systems that make people’s lives tangibly better.
